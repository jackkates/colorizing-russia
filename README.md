# empire-of-color
With permission from the Tsar, Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky traveled the Russian Empire with his camera from 1909 to 1915. Anticipating the rise of color photography, he shot his photos three times with red, green, and blue filters. In this project, I automatically combine these three separate photos to produce the colored version.
